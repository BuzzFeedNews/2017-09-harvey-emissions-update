Affirmative Defense:

1. How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions (compressor, amine unit, etc.) for the 12 month period prior to this incident?
	Reportable: 2	
	Recordable: 6	

2.a. What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 
	7,481 hours

2.b. What was the total number of hours that the facility was down during the past 12 months?
	1,279 hours
3.a.  Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. 

The cause of the emissions event was the ESD discharge blowdown valve on Unit 737 partially opening and allowing a portion of the compressed gas from the unit to exit the system. 

3.b. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable.

Proper maintenance, operating, and design practices were followed per Enterprise policy. 

3.c. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable. 

There were no system warnings indicating that the valve would malfunction and none of the items investigated showed signs of possible malfunction. 

 3.d. Was this incident due to a shut down at another site downstream which is controlled by another regulated entity (RE)?  (If so-which site and who is the RE?)
	
No.

4. How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? 

Not applicable. No air pollution control equipment was involved.

5. How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? 

The operator arrived on-site as soon as they were notified of a potential event by the Houston Gas Control operators. The operator shut the valve once they arrived on-site.

6. How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized?  
	
No pollution control equipment was bypassed. 

7. What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event?  If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. 
	
	The facility is not equipped with emissions monitoring systems.
 
8. How were the owner and or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented?  
 	
	Pipeline pressure data is maintained and internal records are kept.	

9. Have other similar incidents occurred at this/these facility/facilities in the past that might be indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance?

	No. 

10. Identify any information you have (e.g., complaints from neighbors, fence line monitoring, air modeling) which indicates an off-site impact.  Identify any information you have which indicates the unauthorized emissions caused or contributed to an exceedance of the national ambient  air quality standard (NAAQS), a prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) increment, or to a condition of air pollution.

	None known.

11. Do you have any add</td>
