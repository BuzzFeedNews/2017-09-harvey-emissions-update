Emissions Event Incident #265910 on 08/23/2017 @ 5:40

1. Provide the frequency of the facility’s emissions events (reportable/recordable) during the 12 month period prior to and including this incident.  27 Upset and 7 Maintenance events were reported to the TCEQ via STEERS for the past 12 months for this facility.

2. Provide the percentage of the facility’s total annual operating hours during which emissions events (reportable/recordable) occurred (the basis is facility specific, not per incident).  52.4%

3. Did the unauthorized emissions stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by better design, operation, and maintenance practices?  No.

4. Were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events?  Not applicable, there is no pollution control equipment or processes on the plant emergency flare.

5. How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded?  Not applicable.  This was a planned maintenance event.

6.  How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized?  This event was performed in a timely manner to minimize emissions.  No pollution control equipment was bypassed.

7. What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation.  The plant emergency flare meters were operational during this event.

8.  How were the owner’s or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented?  Affirmative as evidenced by the initial and final reports submitted via STEERS.  The plant also maintains a database which documents both recordable and reportable emissions event data. Operational logs for this time period indicate in general terms those actions being taken to resolve the problems.  The plant also maintains a database which documents both recordable and reportable emissions event data.  Initial and final emission event reports for this incident were submitted via STEERS.

9. Were the unauthorized emissions part of a frequent or recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance?  No.

10. Did the unauthorized emissions result in any off-site impact as indicated by complaints from neighbors, fence line monitoring, or air modeling, or did the emissions cause or contribute to an exceedance of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS), of a prevention of significant deterioration (P S</td>
