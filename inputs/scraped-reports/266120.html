		<td colspan="3">On August 24, 2017 at approximately 6:40 am, Flint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (“FHR”) began shutting down the West Refinery operating units in preparation for Hurricane Harvey.  Due to the expedited shutdown of the operating units and the potential for unauthorized emissions, FHR submitted an initial SMSS STEERS report (TCEQ Incident #266120 (AEME ID 148889)) on August 24, 2017, prior to commencing unplanned shutdown activities. The start time and duration above reflect the start time and duration of the overall shutdown activities.   Initially, the depressurization, decommissioning and purging activities associated with the shutdown exceeded the capacity of the Flare Gas Recovery Unit (“FGRU”) thus causing flaring from the second stage flare. Subsequently, as part of the shutdown, the FGRU was shut down once there were not enough combustion sources to consume the captured flare gas.  As a result, flaring continued from the second stage flare until August 29, 2017.  

Upon review following completion of the shutdown, FHR has determined that the flaring activities due to shutdown were contemplated as part of the planned shutdown activities authorized under FHR’s Subchapter B Permit 6819A Maintenance, Startup and Shutdown (“MSS”) Special Conditions, and that the estimated flaring emissions were below the Permit 6819A MAERT VOC, SO2, NOx, CO, and H2S limits for authorized planned MSS activities.  Therefore, the Main Plant Flare System’s FIN/EPN have been removed from this final report.  

As part of the shutdown of the West Refinery in preparation for Hurricane Harvey, both Sulfur Recovery Units (“SRUs”) No. 2 and No. 3 were shut down. The simultaneous shutdown of both SRUs is not a planned shutdown activity and thus is not an authorized MSS scenario under Permit 6819A.  As a result, the unplanned shutdown of both SRUs No. 2 and No. 3 resulted in unauthorized emissions from the Tail Gas Incinerator (“TGI”) associated with the shutdown of the Claus Unit and the Tail Gas Treating Unit. Note, however, that the unauthorized emissions from the SRU shutdowns did not exceed the pre-notification estimates provided in the initial SMSS STEERS report.</td>

		<th align="right" scope="row">Action taken</th>
		<td colspan="3">FHR shut down the West Refinery operating units in preparation for Hurricane Harvey. The activities were conducted as per unit hurricane shutdown procedures.  To the extent possible, unit shutdown, depressurization, and purging was conducted on a staggered basis to control emissions.  During shutdown, it became necessary to route depressurization and purges to the flare to allow the operating units to be shut down in a safe and timely manner (As noted above, the resulting flaring emissions were authorized under Permit 6819A and thus have not been included in this final report.).  Activities were documented in the operation logs as a record for the activity.  In addition to the affirmative defense provided in 30 T.A.C. § 101.222(c), FHR is asserting the defense provided in Texas Water Code § 7.251 for the unauthorized emissions associated with the unplanned shutdown of the West Refinery in preparation for Hurricane Harvey.</td>

		<th align="right" scope="row">Emissions estimation method</th>
		<td colspan="3">Flaring emissions estimates were based on analysis of process data, which included flow meters and concentration analyzers, as applicable, to determine speciation, stream composition, and/or flow rate.   Destruction efficiencies and flare factors are from the “July 1996 TCEQ Technical Guidance Package for Flare Sources”.  As noted above, flaring emissions were authorized under Permit 6819A and thus have not been included in this final report.  The sulfur dioxide emissions from the SRU No. 2 and No. 3 incinerators were calculated using the flow rate of gas through the unit (corrected for chemical reaction and oxygen), the monitored sulfur dioxide concentration out of the TGI stack utilizing a CEMS, and the event duration.  

When either the SRU No. 2 or No. 3 incinerator temperature dropped below 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, hydrogen sulfide emissions were calculated by assuming a one-to-one ratio with the monitored sulfur dioxide concentration out of the TGI stack utilizing a CEMS.</td>
