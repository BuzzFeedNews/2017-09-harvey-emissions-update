		<th align="right" scope="row">Cause</th>
		<td colspan="3">The Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA) experienced an apparent exceedance of it 30-day average mercury emission limit of 1.2 lbs/TeraBtu under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) on 09/10/17.  The 30-day average value recorded by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) for 09/10/2017 was 1.203 lbs/TeraBtu.  There are several factors which may have contributed to this situation which I will discuss below. 1.	TMPA is attempting to use all of its coal pile by early October in preparation for its winter shut down as it transitions to seasonal operation.  In places the pile is already down to dirt.  This clearing of the pile means that coal that has been in the pile for a very long time has recently been burned in the boiler.  TMPA plans to take some core samples of this “bottom of the pile coal” to determine if its chemical nature, including its mercury content, is significantly different from the more recently burned coal.  It is even possible that some of this “bottom of the pile coal” was left on the ground from prior to the conversion to burning Powder Ridge Basin coal (PRB).  Prior to this conversion TMPA burned locally mined lignite.  If analysis of these core samples shows that some of the old lignite is still present and has been burned in the boiler then the 1.2 lbs Hg/TeraBtu MATS limit would not be applicable.  Locally mined lignite would meet the definition of “Low Rank Coal” in the MATS for which the emission limit is 4.0 lbs Hg/TeraBtu.  EPA has communicated by letter to TMPA that the burning of any amount of low rank coal is sufficient to trigger the 4.0 lbs/TeraBtu limit. TMPA will provide a copy of the EPA communications on this topic to the TCEQ.2.	TMPA’s mercury control system consists of three parts.  a.	The coal is sprayed with a calcium bromide solution as it enters the pulverizers ahead of the boiler.  The calcium bromide promotes the conversion of the elemental mercury in the coal to its ionic form in the boiler so that it can be captured within the scrubber.
b.	The scrubber provides a high surface area interface between the flue gas from the boiler and an aqueous solution. Mercury in its ionic form is very soluble in water so an aqueous media provides the ideal environment for scrubbing the mercury from the flue gas.  Unfortunately the solubility limit of mercury in water is relatively low. This means that the scrubber liquor quickly becomes saturated with mercury and is unable to remove more mercury.
c.	This scrubber liquor saturation necessitates the third step in TMPA’s mercury control process: the addition of a mercury precipitation agent to the scrubber liquor. The mercury precipitation agent promotes the removal/precipitation of mercury from the scrubber liquor, reducing its concentration in the liquor phase, thereby allowing additional mercury from the flue gas to dissolve into the scrubber liquor and subsequently precipitated out.  
3.	Over the last several weeks TMPA has experienced several problems with its mercury control system which have led to several periods of increased levels of mercury emissions.  For worker safety reasons TMPA switched last spring from the mercury precipitation agent that it had been using, sodium hydrosulfide, to a commercial preparation called KleenScrub.  The primary concern associated with using sodium hydrosulfide was that it has a high potential to lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide gas. Both of these chemicals have a tendency to plug the in  j e</td>

		<th align="right" scope="row">Action taken</th>
		<td colspan="3">TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown,and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running.   Because the scrubber is known to be aneffective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate "actual" opacity exceedances.TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.</td>

As daylight savings time is now in effect, all times included in this report would need to be increased by one hour to match normal, daylight savings time, clock time.</td>
