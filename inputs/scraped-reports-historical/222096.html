		<th align="right" scope="row">Emissions estimation method</th>
		<td colspan="3">Engineering calculations, flare analyzer meters and process data were used to estimate emissions.Affirmative defense responses per 30 TAC 101.222(b):(1) the owner or operator complies with the requirements of §101.201 of this title (relating to Emissions Event Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements). In the event the owner or operator fails to report as required by §101.201(a)(2) or (3), (b), or (e) of this title, the commission will initiate enforcement for such failure to report and for the underlying emissions event itself. This subsection does not apply when there are minor omissions or inaccuracies that do not impair the commission's ability to review the event according to this rule, unless the owner or operator knowingly or intentionally falsified the information in the report; 
Equistar Response: Timely notifications were made per the requirements of§101.201.  An initial notification was made through STEERS on 10/25/15 12:034, within 24 hours of the discovery of the emissions event.
(2) the unauthorized emissions were caused by a sudden, unavoidable breakdown of equipment or process, beyond the control of the owner or operator; 
Equistar Response: The emissions were caused by a sudden and unexpected mechanical malfunction on an ethylene pump which resulted in an upset.
(3) the unauthorized emissions did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided or planned for, and could not have been avoided by better operation and maintenance practices or technically feasible design consistent with good engineering practice; 
Equistar Response: The emissions were caused by a sudden and unexpected mechanical malfunction on an ethylene pump which resulted in an upset. 
 (4) the air pollution control equipment or processes were maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events; 
Equistar Response: Pollution control equipment functioned as designed. Operator actions followed established procedure to prevent discharge of emissions to the atmosphere by routing the stream to flare systems for thermal destruction.
 (5) prompt action was taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded, and any necessary repairs were made as expeditiously as practicable; 
Equistar Response: Operation technicians responded immediately to the pump malfunction and followed the established procedures to safely manage and minimize emissions. Prompt actions were also initiated by operation personnel to place a spare pump in service and stop the flaring.
(6) the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment were minimized and all possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the unauthorized emissions on ambient air quality; 
Equistar Response: Operation technicians responded immediately and followed procedures to prevent discharge of emissions to the atmosphere by routing the stream to flare systems for thermal destruction. There was no bypass of pollution control equipment.
(7) all emission monitoring systems were kept in operation if possible; 
Equistar Response: Monitoring systems, including flare instrumentation, were operational and online during the event.
(8) the owner or operator actions in response to the unauthorized emissions were documented by contemporaneous operation logs or other relevant evi</td>
