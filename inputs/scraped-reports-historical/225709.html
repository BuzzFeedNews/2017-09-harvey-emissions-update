		<td colspan="3">On 1/8/16 at approximately 1030 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore, an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. On the night of 1/7-8/16 TMPA had operated at minimum sustainable load. During the morning of 1/8/16 the ERCOT price of electricity had been cycling above and below the units strike price which triggers Gibbons Creek to move to full load. This ERCOT price cycling meant that Gibbons Creek was load following (cycling) in attempt to follow the ERCOT needs.  To accomplish this cycling TMPA staff had to regularly switch on and off various coal mills to produce the electricity. The trip was caused by an oxygen concentration drop in the boiler flue gas which led the operator to choose to initiate an emergency shutdown.  Choosing to initiate the emergency shutdown minimized the risk of damage to the unit that could have resulted from a furnace explosion or sudden shutdown triggered by the boiler control system logic. Fire was restored to the boiler by 1050 hours which ended the shutdown and began start-up.  Immediately after the boiler trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before dust exits the stack. The wet scrubber remained in service throughout the outage and was removing particulates from flue gas downstream of the continuous opacity monitor (COM). The ESP was restored to service immediately following the purge. While the ESP was out of service two (2) consecutive apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard were recorded by the continuous opacity monitors (COM) in the ducts beginning at 1036 hours (80.1 and 28.1). Two other apparent non-reportable exceedances occurred during start-up, one beginning at 1100 hours (22.7) and one beginning at 1112 hours (20.2).

Note:  This report was originally submitted by e-mail to Lori Farr of the TCEQ Waco office at 09:37 am on 01/09.  Direct submittal via STEERS at that time was not possible because I was locked out of my STEERS account.</td>

	<tr>
		<th align="right" scope="row">Action taken</th>
		<td colspan="3">TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown,
and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running.   Because the scrubber is known to be an
effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate "actual" opacity exceedances.
TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.</td>

Distributed Control System (DCS) are used to determine emission quantities.  All Data Acquisition Handling System (DAHS) data is provided on
CST basis as directed by EPA Region 6. Operational time is also reported in CST. At this time of year all time is in CST so no conversion is necessary.</td>
