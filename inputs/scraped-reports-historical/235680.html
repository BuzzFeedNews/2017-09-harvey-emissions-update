		<td colspan="3">On June 13, 2016 at 07:30 a.m., a scheduled load of isoamylene was delivered to the site.  While preparing to unload the raw material, 2-Methyl-2-Butene (isoamylene), into its respective tank (4-T-26A), the shift supervisor noticed the tank’s level indicator was reading zero (0) percent volume.  This caught the immediate attention of the shift supervisor because at last check the tank’s level indicator was reading ten (10) percent volume; however, no product that used isoamylene was being produced at that time, hence the tank’s level indicator should have remained at ten (10) percent volume.  An inspection of the process line was conducted from the isoamylene tank to the Multi-Purpose Unit (MPU) Continuous process.  No leaks or spills were identified from the process line inspection.  The shift supervisor proceeded with unloading the isoamylene into the respective tank (4-T-26A) assuming it was a tank level instrumentation issue.  After the tank was loaded, it was identified the tank’s level continued to slowly decrease.  To further investigate this, plant operations were ceased and the production unit was cleared to allow access into the unit for further inspection.  At 15:14 hrs., it was discovered that the bleed valve at the isoamylene flow meter was partially open and flowing into the process unit sewer pipe which flows into the MPU acid sump.  The valve was immediately closed and the tank isolated.  Level trends within the process information historian (PI) were evaluated and concluded that the release initially began on June 11, 2016 at 01:00 hrs and continued until the valve was closed on June 13, 2016 at 15:14 hrs.  Approximately 4,800 pounds of isoamylene was released from the tank to the acid sump via the process drain line over this time period.  Arkema has concluded that due to volatility of the isoamylene that approximately 4800 lbs of the material was lost to the air through the sump and waste water system.  For safety purposes when handling organic peroxide wastewater, Arkema’s sumps and wastewater system are not designed to control volatile air emissions. The root cause of this incident was the bleed valve at the isoamylene flow meter was found in a partially open position. Arkema believes that the drain valve was inadvertently opened in the early morning of June 11, 2016.  There was no CERCLA/EPRA RQ release involved in this incident.</td>

Permanent connections were removed and bull plugs were installed on the bleed valves; 4)A raw material inventory scorecard was developed and is now being monitored every shift (twice daily).</td>
