		<th align="right" scope="row">Cause</th>
		<td colspan="3">On 8/19/15 at approximately 1733 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. The trip was caused by plugage of multiple coal feeders.  A switch to a different coal feeder was not successful and led to very low percent O2 in the boiler.  Because of the explosive nature of such a gas mixture immediate shutdown of the boiler was initiated.  At that point the switchyard should have switched from routing electricity from the plant to the grid to from the grid to the plant.  This switch did not take place.  The result was that the plant lost all power, with the exception of some battery and other back-up power.  Because there was no power all fans shutdown.  Without fans valid opacity readings are not possible and so there are no opacity exceedances recorded during this time period.  The B-side ID fan was brought back into service at about 0024 hours CST on 8/20/15 and the A-side ID fan at about 0612 hours CST on 8/20/15.  Valid opacity readings on each side resumed when the fans became operational.  Because of the uncontrolled nature of the shutdown much coal dust and ash were left in the unit to be pulled free as the fans resumed service.  Because of the low temperature limit on electrostatic precipitator (ESP) use it could not be immediately brought back into service as the fans started.   Because of the larger than usual coal dust and ash loading through the unit, there have been multiple recorded opacity exceedances at or above 35%.  The first such period was from 0312 hours CST until 0354 hours CST.  The next was from 0536 to 0642 hours, then from 0630 to 00642 hours CST, then at 0712 hours, and 0724 hours.  The last reportable exceedance occurred at 0836 hours CST.  Because start-up is still just beginning it is possible that additional periods of reportable excess opacity may occur as a result of this incident.  Should such exceedances occur they will be submitted as a second report.  This report is being submitted now to avoid being in violation of the within 24 hour requirement to report reportable events.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th align="right" scope="row">Action taken</th>
		<td colspan="3">TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown,
and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. TMPA was not able to leave the scrubber running in this case because the loss of power shut it down as well.  Because the scrubber is known to be an
effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate "actual" opacity exceedances.
TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.</td>
