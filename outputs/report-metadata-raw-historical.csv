"Upon identification of this incident, FHR initiated prompt measures to assess, minimize, and correct the upset conditions. Fence line air monitoring was performed for VOC’s, H2S, SO2, HCN, and CO, and no emissions were detected. The following units were started up using normal operation procedures on the following dates: April 1st, #3 Isomerization Unit, on April 2nd CCR, #1 Sat Gas, GOHT, HDS, DDS and NHT, April 3rd the HDC and MSTDP.","On April 1, 2015, at around 2:05 AM, flaring occurred for approximately sixty six minutes at the Flint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (“FHR”) West Refinery due to the unplanned shutdown of the recycle compressor in the Continuous Catalytic Regeneration (“CCR”) unit. The shutdown of the CCR resulted in a loss of hydrogen to the Hydrocracker Unit (“HDC”); due to the loss of hydrogen, a controlled emergency shutdown procedure was initiated. As part of this shutdown, the contents of the HDC reactor relieved into the flare system. As the amount of gas relieved into the flare system exceeded the capacity of the flare gas recovery unit, flaring occurred. At approximately the same time, a pump (39GA3911A) in the CCR unit developed a leak of approximately 3 gallons of benzene containing material to containment. Based on a review of the event, it is believed that the 39GA3911A seal leak was a secondary effect of the CCR unit shutdown and FHR’s associated response. Additional process units that shut down as a result of the loss of hydrogen included the Gas Oil Hydrotreating Unit (“GOHT”), the Naphtha Hydrotreating Unit (“NHT”), the Mobil Selective Toluene Disproportionation Process Unit (“MSTDP”), the Hydrodesulfurization Unit (“HDS”), the Distillate Desulfurizer (“DDS”), the #3 Isomerization Unit, and the #1 Saturated Gas unit.","CORPUS CHRISTI, NUECES","FHR’s refined calculations determined that a reportable quantity was exceeded for SO2 only.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 4/27/15 at approximately 0314 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. The trip was caused by electrical problems probably caused by a lightning strike. Immediately after the boiler trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of flammable gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before dust exits the stack. The wet scrubber remained in service throughout the outage and was removing particulates from flue gas downstream of the continuous opacity monitor (COM). The ESP was restored to service prior to hours CST. While the ESP was out of service two (2) consecutive apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard were recorded by the continuous opacity monitors (COM) in the ducts beginning at 0312 hours (41.4 and 62.0%). A natural gas fueled fire was restored in the boiler at approximately 0345 hours CST. This event began an MMS start-up and thus ended the shutdown. No further excess emissions occurred which were not during the planned start-up and so these emissions are not reportable. For completeness the following list contains the times, opacities and current explanations for each of the subsequent periods of opacity emissions above the “normal” 20% opacity limit. 0348-0359 hours (37.2 and 36.1%) boiler restart. 0430 hours (40.4%) unknown. 0506-0517 hours (93.0 and 44.9%) unknown. 0718 hours (48.6%) boiler and ESP shutdown to deal with steam temperature problem.

"After removal of the water and gasoline water mixture from the tank roof, the roof drain system was cleared of flow restricting materials to allow storm water to drain at a higher rate. The tank has remained in operation and had no issues draining water during Topical Storm Bill event. As for the phase out of the tank (or taking it out of service for API 653 inspection), the tank roof has been determined to be in serviceable condition after this incident and therefore will follow the regular API 653 inspection and maintenance schedule.","The incident investigation team concluded the root causes of the incident were flow restrictions in the tank floating roof drain system. A contributing factor was the extreme rainfall, estimated at approximately 9 inches, that occurred the evening of May 25th and morning of May 26th. The restrictions impeded the extreme flow of storm water from the roof through the drain system to the ground, somewhat like leaves clogging a rain gutter. This resulted in water accumulating on the roof. The weight of the water on the roof resulted in the roof sinking on one side slightly into the gasoline stored in the tank. Note that the floating roof pan is normally in full contact with the gasoline stored in the tank. As roof was weighted and sank, some of the gasoline from the tank moved upwards through the annular spaces between the leg sleeves and the roof legs and onto the surface of the water accumulated on the roof.","PASADENA, HARRIS","Based on field observations of the EFR in the tank the morning of the incident, it was estimated that 2/3 of the center deck area of the EFR roof surface was covered in water and/or gasoline. The exact surface area of the liquid could not be determined due to the complexity in calculating the actual surface area of the liquid surface on the listing deck. The deck area has a diameter of 124 ft. Total surface area of this section of the roof is 12,076 ft2 and 2/3rd of this area is 8,055 ft2. An evaporation rate of 0.02013 lbs./ft2-hr was determined from a computer model run using various temperatures and wind speeds. Other pool evaporative loss equations were tried, but the results were unreasonably high. Based on the estimate of the time the incident started and the end of the removal of water/gasoline mixture, the total time gasoline was on the roof was conservatively estimate at 20 hours. The estimated VOC emissions were determined by multiplying the liquid surface area by the emission factor then by 20 hrs. The calculated emissions were 3,243 lbs. The HAP emissions were calculated using the vapor weight percent of each compound used for EIQ emission calculations.

Due to the extra pressure on the roof from the ladder, these areas tend to be low points where water typically collects. The low areas hold water and may have accelerated the corrosion of the roof. At some point in the past, fiberglass patches were placed over and extend past the repads. The part of the floating roof under the rolling ladder tends to flex, which appears to have caused the fiberglass to develop cracks and separate from the carbon steel.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. TMPA was not able to leave the scrubber running in this case because the loss of power shut it down as well. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 8/19/15 at approximately 1733 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. The trip was caused by plugage of multiple coal feeders. A switch to a different coal feeder was not successful and led to very low percent O2 in the boiler. Because of the explosive nature of such a gas mixture immediate shutdown of the boiler was initiated. At that point the switchyard should have switched from routing electricity from the plant to the grid to from the grid to the plant. This switch did not take place. The result was that the plant lost all power, with the exception of some battery and other back-up power. Because there was no power all fans shutdown. Without fans valid opacity readings are not possible and so there are no opacity exceedances recorded during this time period. The B-side ID fan was brought back into service at about 0024 hours CST on 8/20/15 and the A-side ID fan at about 0612 hours CST on 8/20/15. Valid opacity readings on each side resumed when the fans became operational. Because of the uncontrolled nature of the shutdown much coal dust and ash were left in the unit to be pulled free as the fans resumed service. Because of the low temperature limit on electrostatic precipitator (ESP) use it could not be immediately brought back into service as the fans started. Because of the larger than usual coal dust and ash loading through the unit, there have been multiple recorded opacity exceedances at or above 35%. The first such period was from 0312 hours CST until 0354 hours CST. The next was from 0536 to 0642 hours, then from 0630 to 00642 hours CST, then at 0712 hours, and 0724 hours. The last reportable exceedance occurred at 0836 hours CST. Because start-up is still just beginning it is possible that additional periods of reportable excess opacity may occur as a result of this incident.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 9/12/15 at approximately 1230 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. The cause of the trip is under investigation. Because of the explosive nature of such a gas mixture immediate shutdown of the boiler was initiated. During the trip fans shut down as well. Without fans valid opacity readings are not possible and so there are no opacity exceedances recorded during this time period. The B-side ID fan was brought back into service at about 1330 hours CST on 9/12/15 and the A-side ID fan at about 1342 hours CST on 9/12/15. Valid opacity readings on each side resumed when the fans became operational. Because of the low temperature limit on electrostatic precipitator (ESP) use it could not be immediately brought back into service as the fans started. Although no reportable exceedances of the opacity limit were recorded, it is likely that some occurred immediately following the trip when valid opacity readings were not available. The only recorded apparent exceedance associated with this incident began at 1336 hours CST on the B-side (32.4%). There was one additional reading of 26.6% which began at 1342 hours on the B-side, but it is covered by the one per hour less than 27% allowance in TMPA's permit and so is not an exceedance.

"Upon identification of this incident, FHR initiated prompt measures to assess, minimize, and correct the upset conditions. Operations personnel cleaned out the strainer on charge pump 02GA227 and restarted the pump. Flaring stopped when the pump was restarted and the unit stabilized.","On November 6, 2015, at approximately 9:38 PM, flaring occurred for approximately 33 minutes at the Flint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (“FHR”) West Refinery due to the unanticipated shutdown of the #2 Vapor Recovery Unit (“VRU”) charge pumps in the Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Unit (“FCCU”). This unanticipated shutdown occurred when charge pump, 02GA227, lost flow due to a plugged strainer. When swapping to the spare pump, 02GA227S, Operations personnel discovered that a check valve was stuck in the open position that caused product to be recirculated within the set of pumps and did not allow product to flow to a stripping tower in the VRU. The loss of product flow to the stripping tower caused the product level to decrease, which then caused lighter weight hydrocarbons to be sent to the No. 2 Debutanizer, 02DA203. The lighter weight hydrocarbons in the No. 2 Debutanizer caused a buildup in pressure. Operations personnel de-pressurized the No. 2 Debutanizer, to the flare gas recovery (“FGR”) system to eliminate the safety risk of expected increasing pressure in the No. 2 Debutanizer and then relying on activation of the safety relief devices (pressure relief valves) to stay within design pressure of the No. 2 Debutanizer.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 1/8/16 at approximately 1030 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced an unplanned boiler trip. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore, an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. On the night of 1/7-8/16 TMPA had operated at minimum sustainable load. During the morning of 1/8/16 the ERCOT price of electricity had been cycling above and below the units strike price which triggers Gibbons Creek to move to full load. This ERCOT price cycling meant that Gibbons Creek was load following (cycling) in attempt to follow the ERCOT needs. To accomplish this cycling TMPA staff had to regularly switch on and off various coal mills to produce the electricity. The trip was caused by an oxygen concentration drop in the boiler flue gas which led the operator to choose to initiate an emergency shutdown. Choosing to initiate the emergency shutdown minimized the risk of damage to the unit that could have resulted from a furnace explosion or sudden shutdown triggered by the boiler control system logic. Fire was restored to the boiler by 1050 hours which ended the shutdown and began start-up. Immediately after the boiler trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before dust exits the stack. The wet scrubber remained in service throughout the outage and was removing particulates from flue gas downstream of the continuous opacity monitor (COM). The ESP was restored to service immediately following the purge. While the ESP was out of service two (2) consecutive apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard were recorded by the continuous opacity monitors (COM) in the ducts beginning at 1036 hours (80.1 and 28.1). Two other apparent non-reportable exceedances occurred during start-up, one beginning at 1100 hours (22.7) and one beginning at 1112 hours (20.2).

"Operations and technical personnel worked to reset the vent valve and restart the blower allowing for the return of the oil feed to the process unit. Once the oil feed was put back into the process and the unit was stabilized, the torch oil was removed from the regenerator lowering the CO concentration in the overhead flue gas to the ESP. This permitted the restarting of the ESP to capture the catalyst particles and thus lowering of the opacity.","At 13:00 the 20"" vent valve opened up unexpectedly causing the C-100 blower to shutdown.

"Upon identification of this incident, FHR initiated prompt measures to assess, minimize, and correct the upset conditions. An emergency operations center (“EOC”) was initiated during the power outage to bring the refinery to a safe and stable state. Fence line air monitoring was performed for VOCs, H2S, SO2, HCN, and CO, and no emissions were detected. A third party inspection company performed a visual inspection of the external floating roof tank, 15FB507. The tank roof and seals were inspected and the inspectors found no product on the roof, no product behind the primary mechanic shoe seal the secondary rim-mounted wiper, and no issues with the seal.

The volume of gas from these units exceeded the FGR capacity which resulted in intermittent flaring that began at 1:21 PM and lasted for approximately 159 minutes. The Hydro Desulfurization (“HDS”) Unit was also shut down as a result of the loss of hydrogen from the CCR. During the shutdown of the NHT Unit, the NHT Depentanizer tower experienced abnormal conditions as a result of a unit power outage.

TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 5/9/16 at approximately 0342 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit was manually tripped by the Operator initiating a shutdown. Because the unit trip was unplanned the definitions and provisions contained in TMPA's Maintenance, Start-up and Shutdown (MSS) permit for a shutdown do not apply. Therefore, an initial report needs to be filed for the resulting apparent opacity exceedance(s). Also, 10 day advance notice was not possible because the unit trip was not planned. The trip was initiated because of a major leak of hydraulic actuator fluid (EHC) on one of the turbine control valves. A shutdown was necessary both for equipment protection and to initiate EHC clean up. The cause of the leak is due to faulty O-rings on the actuator. Immediately after the boiler trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before dust exits the stack.

1)Develop a list of critical bleed valves and incorporate them into our car seal program; 2)Include the drain valve in our continuous unit product startup checklist to ensure the correct valve position exists before unit start-up; 3)Survey conducted of bleed valves in the unit that were permanently connected to the sewer. Permanent connections were removed and bull plugs were installed on the bleed valves; 4)A raw material inventory scorecard was developed and is now being monitored every shift (twice daily).,"On June 13, 2016 at 07:30 a.m., a scheduled load of isoamylene was delivered to the site. While preparing to unload the raw material, 2-Methyl-2-Butene (isoamylene), into its respective tank (4-T-26A), the shift supervisor noticed the tank’s level indicator was reading zero (0) percent volume. This caught the immediate attention of the shift supervisor because at last check the tank’s level indicator was reading ten (10) percent volume; however, no product that used isoamylene was being produced at that time, hence the tank’s level indicator should have remained at ten (10) percent volume. An inspection of the process line was conducted from the isoamylene tank to the Multi-Purpose Unit (MPU) Continuous process. No leaks or spills were identified from the process line inspection. The shift supervisor proceeded with unloading the isoamylene into the respective tank (4-T-26A) assuming it was a tank level instrumentation issue. After the tank was loaded, it was identified the tank’s level continued to slowly decrease. To further investigate this, plant operations were ceased and the production unit was cleared to allow access into the unit for further inspection. At 15:14 hrs., it was discovered that the bleed valve at the isoamylene flow meter was partially open and flowing into the process unit sewer pipe which flows into the MPU acid sump. The valve was immediately closed and the tank isolated. Level trends within the process information historian (PI) were evaluated and concluded that the release initially began on June 11, 2016 at 01:00 hrs and continued until the valve was closed on June 13, 2016 at 15:14 hrs. Approximately 4,800 pounds of isoamylene was released from the tank to the acid sump via the process drain line over this time period. Arkema has concluded that due to volatility of the isoamylene that approximately 4800 lbs of the material was lost to the air through the sump and waste water system. For safety purposes when handling organic peroxide wastewater, Arkema’s sumps and wastewater system are not designed to control volatile air emissions. The root cause of this incident was the bleed valve at the isoamylene flow meter was found in a partially open position. Arkema believes that the drain valve was inadvertently opened in the early morning of June 11, 2016. There was no CERCLA/EPRA RQ release involved in this incident.","CROSBY, HARRIS","The released quantity amount was determined to be a rate of 77.1 lbs/hr.

"Upon identification of this incident, FHR initiated prompt measures to assess, minimize, and correct the upset conditions. Since the majority of the flare gas from the CCR was made up of hydrogen, the composition of flare gas being sent to the FGRU and subsequently to the Coker Wet Gas Compressor needed to be supplemented with purchased gas in order to increase its overall molecular weight. After supplementing the flare gas with natural gas, the Coker Wet Gas Compressor again was able to compress the recovered flare gas from the FGRU, resulting in the end of the flaring activity.
