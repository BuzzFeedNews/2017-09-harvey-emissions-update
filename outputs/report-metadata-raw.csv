The PSV’s set point was raised, the flow rate through the existing cooler was increased and an additional cooler was installed which together has prevented additional emissions events. Furthermore, the plant is closely monitoring the tank pressure to help prevent future venting and is in the process of formulating a permanent corrective action.","While tank D-4110 was being prepared to support the production of plasticizer in the PX Unit, the tank pressurized and vented VOCs to atmosphere via a pressure safety valve (PSV) due to a faulty pressure valve (PV) and not fully utilizing an existing cooler.

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/16/2017 6:00PM,08/17/2017 1:45AM,"FROM STANTON, TEXAS: FOLLOW I-20 WEST FOR APPROXIMATELY 5.5 MILES, THEN HEAD NORTH ON COUNTY ROAD 3001/FM829.

These responses should be addressed under the appropriate sections of the final report for the incident eg; Cause of Emissions Event, Actions Taken to Minimize Emissions, and Any Additional Information Necessary to Evaluate the Event. (1) How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions during this incident for the 12 month period prior to this incident? ~34 (2) What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 8760 (3) Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable. COMPRESSOR DOWN DUE TO RIGHT HAND LUBRICATOR NO FLOW. FLARING WAS USED TO MINIMIZE EMISSIONS UNTIL PLANT COULD BE RETURNED TO MORMAL OPERATIONS.. (4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event. The emission estimates were calculated by use of the gas flow rate and gas analysis.

These responses should be addressed under the appropriate sections of the final report for the incident eg; Cause of Emissions Event, Actions Taken to Minimize Emissions, and Any Additional Information Necessary to Evaluate the Event. (1) How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions during this incident for the 12 month period prior to this incident? ~34 (2) What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 8760 (3) Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable.COMPRESSOR WENT DOWN DUE TO LUBRICATOR NO FLOW.

(4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event.

The plant was brought back online when the moisture was thawed ending the emission event. Inlet gas was routed to other plants as possible to minimize the event. All activities were performed as quick as possible allowing for safety.,"An unexpected slippage of moisture from the molecular sieve beds to the cryogenic process caused a freeze up and the need to shut down the plant to thaw the moisture. This directed inlet gas and residue gas to the EPNs C-1 Flare, Consolidator Flare and the B-Plant Flare.","MIDKIFF, REAGAN","Step 1:For each gas component, calculate Net Molecular Weight (MW):Net MW (lb/lb-mole) =Mole % of Component/100 x MW of ComponentExample using propane:Net MW = 8.7522/100 x 44.10 lb/lb-mole = 3.86 lb/lb-mole Step 2: Calculate the Mass of Each Gas Component Emitted Mass of Component = (Net MW of Component/Molar Volume) x Volume Emitted Molar Volume = 379.5 scf/lb-mole Volume Emitted = Recorded Data From Flow Meter Or Calculated in the Case of Pipeline Releases as Follows: Cross-Sectional Area x Length x (Pipeline Pressure + Atmospheric Pressure)/Atmospheric Pressure Example using propane and recorded data: Volume emitted = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb Example using propane and calculated area: Pipe Diameter,d = 12 inches Pipe Length, l = 165,470 feet Pipe Pressure, ppipe = 50 psig Atmospheric Pressure, patmos = 14.70 psia Volume = (Pi)(d2/4)(l)(( ppipe + patmos)/ patmos) = (3.141592)((12/12)^2/4))(165,470)((50 + 14.7)/14.7) = 572,000 scf Mass of Propane Emitted = (3.86 lb/lb-mole)/(379.5 scf/lb-mole) x 572,000 scf = 5,818 lb For venting episodes, this calculation is repeated for each gas component and the mass emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/22/2017 7:15AM,08/22/2017 3:40PM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,FINAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266018

The unauthorized emissions did not stem from any activity or event that could have been forseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by better design operation and maintenance practices. The air pollution control equipment and processes were maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emission events. The amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions were minimized by placing the AGI system back in service as soon as the 3rd stage scrubber was drained and the use of the AGI flare. The emission monitoring system (AGI flare meter) was in service during the event. Actions in response to the unauthorized emission are documented on operating and flare logs. The shutdown of the AGI due to high 3rd stage scrubber level is not a frequent or recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation or maintenance. There was no offsite impact.

Additionally the plant lost ability to control H2S so the plant went sour and gas had to be flared until the H2S was in acceptable range for transferring to customers.","GOLDSMITH, ECTOR","Carbon Dioxide: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0091035 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole}Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1258.137-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 40040 {mcf/event} * 1258.137 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf}Ethane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.095215 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98)Hexane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0069583 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98)Hydrogen Sulfide: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0104602 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98)i-Butane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0055598 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.004493 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.7693065 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0170897 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0057922 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 40040 {mcf/event} * 1258.137 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 40040 {mcf/event} * 1258.137 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95 Nitrogen: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0274515 {mole fraction} * 28 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Propane: 40040 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0485703 {mole fraction} * 44.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Sulfur Dioxide: (37096.05328 {lb/event for Hydrogen Sulfide} / 34.1 {lb/lb-mole for Hydrogen Sulfide}) * 64.1 {lb/lb-mole for SO2} * 0.98 {Control Efficiency} VOC: Sum of emissions: 4455.25648 {lb/event for Propane} + 2065.967 {lb/event for n-Butane} + 674.2735 {lb/event for i-Pentane} + 869.24704 {lb/event for n-Pentane} + 671.89071 {lb/event for i-Butane} + 1247.59536 {lb/event for Hexane} 5# Flare Carbon Dioxide: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.020318 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1406.272-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 6 {mcf/event} * 1406.272 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} Ethane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1199279 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.014721 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.033306 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.012443 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.009946 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.6045034 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.039477 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 6 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.011977 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 6 {mcf/event} * 1406.272 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.138 {lb/mmBtu} * 6 {mcf/event} * 1406.272 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95",08/22/2017 11:00PM,08/23/2017 10:00AM,FROM THE INTERSECTION OF SR 158 GULF AVE AND FM 866 LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF GOLDSMITH 31.0 MILES W OF MIDLAND DRIVE 1.1 MILE WEST ON SR 158 TO THE GAS PLANT ON THE RIGHT,RN100222330,GOLDSMITH GAS PLANT,FINAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266050

Due to the expedited shutdown of the operating units and the potential for unauthorized emissions, FHR submitted an initial SMSS STEERS report (TCEQ Incident #266114 (AEME ID 148863)) on August 24, 2017, prior to commencing unplanned shutdown activities. The start time and duration above reflect the start time and duration of the overall shutdown activities.As part of the shutdown, the Flare Gas Recovery Unit (“FGRU”) was shut down once there were not enough combustion sources to consume the captured flare gas. As a result, flaring occurred from the 36” flare until August 30, 2017. Upon review following completion of the shutdown, FHR has determined that the flaring activities due to shutdown were contemplated as part of the planned shutdown activities authorized under FHR’s Flexible Permit 6308 Maintenance, Startup and Shutdown (“MSS”) Special Conditions, and that the estimated flaring emissions were below the Permit 6308 MAERT SO2, NOx, VOC, CO, and H2S limits for authorized planned MSS activities. Therefore, the 36 Inch Plant Flare’s FIN/EPN have been removed from this final report. As part of the shutdown of the East Refinery in preparation for Hurricane Harvey, both Sulfur Recovery Units (“SRUs”) No. 1 and No. 2 were shut down. The simultaneous shutdown of both SRUs is not a planned shutdown activity and thus is not an authorized MSS scenario under Permit 6308.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 08/23/17 at approximately 2332 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced a unit trip due to ground fault on the “A” Primary Air (PA) fan. The “A” PA fan will be out until the issue is resolved. Following the purge the igniters restored fire in the boiler at 0052 hours CST on 08/24/17 using just the “B” PA fan. Immediately after the trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before they exit the stack. The ESP was placed back in to service at 0102 hours CST. From 2336 hours through 2347 hours two (2) apparent reportable exceedances of the opacity standard were recorded by the COMs in the ducts (51.3 and 46.5). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 0100 hours through 0105 hours (23.0) on 08/24/2017. During the start-up a second unit trip occurred at 0430 hours CST due to loss of the warm-up guns. Following this trip, from 0448 hours through 0459 hours two (2) additional apparent reportable exceedances of the standard occurred (70.2 and 49.9). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 0530 hours through 0535 hours (25.3).

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/24/2017 2:51PM,08/24/2017 9:51PM,,RN106494842,COLE RANCH COMPRESSOR STATION,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266234

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/26/2017 7:21AM,08/26/2017 10:23AM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266265

These estimates may or may not be indicative of the actual amounts or compounds released. It is likely that better emissions estimates will be provided in the Final State of Texas Environmental Electronic Reporting System (STEERS) Report.” By the way of clarification, at the time of the Initial STEERS report, FHR utilized available information, engineering experience and engineering calculations to identify the substances FHR anticipated could experience a release of an amount that might exceed an RQ.

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown, and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be an effective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","On 08/27/17 at approximately 1253 hours Central Standard Time (CST) the TMPA Gibbons Creek unit experienced a unit trip due to a ‘low pressure trip’ in the boiler. Several subsequent trips followed. Immediately after the trip, the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was taken out of service until a purge of combustible gasses could be completed to protect the equipment and for personnel safety. The ESP captures dust emissions before they exit the stack. The purge was initiated at 1540 CST. The ESP was placed back in service following the completion of the purge although subsequent trips necessitated taking it out of service again. From 1300 hours through 1305 hours one (1) apparent reportable exceedance of the opacity standard was recorded by the COMs in the ducts (73.8). One (1) additional apparent non-reportable exceedance of the standard occurred from 1306 hours through 1311 hours (31.7) on 08/27/2017.

Until the Refinery has produced sufficient inventory for the operation of the Flare Gas Recovery Unit (“FGRU”) and the FGRU is able to provide sufficient fuel gas to combustion sources, flaring will occur from the second stage flare during the commissioning activities. The West Plant Sulfur Recovery Units (“SRU’s”) No. 2 and No. 3 will also be restarted after shutdown in preparation for Hurricane Harvey. The potential emissions from the SRU’s No. 2 and No. 3 will be associated with the bypass of the Tail Gas Treating Unit, which will result in tail gas being routed directly to the Tail Gas Incinerator (“TGI”).

We will provide actual event details in our final report.","CORPUS CHRISTI, NUECES",Past events were used to estimate emissions for the startup flaring. Flare gas composition is based on a weighted average between normal baseline flare load and the expected worst-case flow rate into the flare system. Destruction efficiencies and flare factors are from the “July 1996 TCEQ Technical Guidance Package for Flare Sources”. Past events were used to estimate emissions for the SRU’s No 2 and No. 3. The emissions estimate is based on a flow estimate calculated from inputs into the unit and corrected for chemical reaction. This flow was used in conjunction with historical SO2 concentration data gathered by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) on the TGI stack to calculate SO2 emissions. All emissions included in this report are an estimate of the maximum emissions and may or may not be indicative of the actual amounts released.

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency.

How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions (compressor, amine unit, etc.) for the 12 month period prior to this incident? Reportable: 1 Recordable: 0 2.a. What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 8,760 hours 2.b. What was the total number of hours that the facility was down during the past 12 months? 0 hours 3.a. Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. The PSV is set to relieve at 1150 psig. The valve relieved at approximately 996 psig. TEAM Industrial Services conducted an investigation on the valve on August 30, 2017. TEAM concluded that either the pilot or the valve body had failed and caused the PSV to relieve prematurely. 3.b. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable. Maintenance, operating, and design practices were followed per Enterprise policy. The PSV underwent an annual third party test on February 1, 2017 and passed. 3.c. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable. The exact cause of the PSV relieving prematurely could not be determined, but two possible causes were identified. The PSV passed the annual test in February 2017. There were no system warnings indicating that the valve would malfunction. 3.d. Was this incident due to a shut down at another site downstream which is controlled by another regulated entity (RE)? (If so-which site and who is the RE?) No. 4. How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Not applicable. No air pollution control equipment was involved. 5. How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? The operator arrived on-site as soon as they were notified of a potential event by the Supervisor. The operator shut the valve once they arrived on-site. 6. How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? No pollution control equipment was bypassed. 7. What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. The facility is not equipped with emissions monitoring systems. 8. How were the owner and or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? Pipeline pressure data is maintained and internal records are kept. 9. Have other similar incidents occurred at this/these facility/facilities in the past that might be indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance? No. 10.

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.138 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.138 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 103.01 lb CO Emission = 0.2755 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 360.09 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",08/30/2017 12:11AM,08/30/2017 3:00PM,FROM FM 3095 AND FM 2401 IN MIDKIFF E 4.25 MI ON FM 2401 TO PLANT ENTRANCE,RN100215714,MIDKIFF GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266557

Power was restored and INVISTA is in the process of restoring other systems and evaluating the impact from the Hurricane with available limited resources. Both flares were operating properly during the venting period. The venting to the Startup Flare stopped once the west converters were completely shut down and the venting to the Ammonia Flare ceased once the west ammonia train pressure decreased and stabilized. The west ammonia train was not shut down as the shutdown and startup emissions are higher than the emissions from running the West ammonia train. The spill was contained within the building.,"This is for documentation purpose only as regulation 30 TAC 101 is suspended due to hurricane Harvey through the Governor's proclamation. As a result of hurricane Harvey, ADN unit lost power and as a result, HCN west converters were shut down and vented to the Startup Flare per procedure. Due to the shutdown of the west train converters, excess amount of ammonia in the west ammonia train vented to the Ammonia Flare per procedure. Additionally, organics spilled into the building containment from the Organic Receiver because of the effects of the power outage on equipment and systems.","ORANGE, ORANGE","Process data, process knowledge and emission estimates.",08/30/2017 4:22AM,08/30/2017 1:47PM,,RN104392626,INVISTA SARL SABINE RIVER SITE,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266565

"Once the leak was found, the leak area was immediately barricaded. Firewater was used to suppress the vapors. The firewater was routed to on-site wastewater. The pressure of the line was reduced, which significantly reduced the leak rate. Operations set up hoses to route EO in the line to a rerun/off-spec tank to reduce the amount released to atmosphere. The initial leak rate of 4.67 pounds per hour decreased to 0.006 pounds per hour because of the lowered pressure on the piping. The water run-off was later diverted into the on-site sewer system. After the leak was completely stopped, UCC repaired the portion of piping and has removed additional insulation for piping inspection. All piping will be pressure tested and reinsulated once the inspections are complete.",The event was related to hurricane Harvey and the disruptions associated with the storm including loss of electrical power.

As part of the shutdown of the Refinery in preparation for Hurricane Harvey, the Fuel Gas Recovery Unit (“FGRU”) was shut down once there were not enough combustion sources to consume the captured flare gas. As a result, during commissioning activities associated with the Refinery startup, FHR began flaring from its second stage flare. Flaring will continue until the Refinery has produced sufficient inventory for the operation of the FGRU and the FGRU is able to provide sufficient fuel gas to combustion sources.

These responses should be addressed under the appropriate sections of the final report for the incident eg; Cause of Emissions Event, Actions Taken to Minimize Emissions, and Any Additional Information Necessary to Evaluate the Event. (1) How many reportable and recordable emissions events (including this incident) have occurred at the facility/facilities contributing emissions during this incident for the 12 month period prior to this incident? ~5 (2) What were the facility/facilities total actual operating hours during the past 12 months? 8760 (3) Identify the cause or causes of the emissions event and include all contributing factors that led to the emissions event. Discuss how the emissions event could not have been avoided by good design, maintenance, and operation practices, if applicable. Discuss any sudden breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator’s control, if applicable. REASON FOR FLARE: BOOSTER COMPRESSOR WENT DOWN DUE TO BLOWN FUSE IN ELECTRIC PANEL.FLARING USED TO MINIMIZE EMISSIONS UNTIL REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.(4) How were the air pollution control equipment or processes (if any) maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emissions events? Flaring was used to minimize emissions. Flares were properly operated. (5) How soon was action taken to achieve compliance once the operator knew or should have known that applicable emission limitations were being exceeded? Once the control panel shut the compressor down gas was immediately routed to the flare (6) How were the amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions and any bypass of pollution control equipment minimized? Emissions were minimized by use of a flare. The flare is the control device, functioned properly, and there was no pollution control equipment bypass. (7) What was the operational status of all emission monitoring systems at the facility/facilities during this emissions event? If any emission monitoring systems were not kept in operation during the emissions event, explain why they weren’t kept in operation. No monitoring systems are required for this site. Field gas production from this site was diverted to the flare and the flare remained ignited until the pressures dropped below the rated pressures for the equipment at this site. (8) How were the owner or operator’s actions in response to the unauthorized emissions contemporaneously documented? The TCEQ STEERS reporting system was used to provide initial notice of the event. The emission estimates were calculated by use of t he gas flow rate and gas analysis.

Action was taken to achieve compliance at the time of discovery. Operations increased the flow through the A turbine reducing the demand on the B turbine. The recycle valve was closed pushing gas to the second stage and allow the control system to return to normal operations. Third party contractors have been on-site with improving the control scheme that may cause the low flow and initiate the recycle.,"The emissions were caused by the sudden, unavoidable breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator's control, and did not stem from activity that could have been foreseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by good design, operation, and maintenance practices. The second stage on B turbine experienced low flow that forced the recycle valve to open. With the second stage shut down, the pressure in the first stage increased above the setpoint that automatically shut the turbine down that led to flaring.","GOLDSMITH, ECTOR","Carbon Dioxide: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0146442 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1336.732-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 1937 {mcf/event} * 1336.732 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} Ethane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1173668 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.012811 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0175504 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0093492 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0077006 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.6805739 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0290552 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0096122 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 1937 {mcf/event} * 1336.732 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 1937 {mcf/event} * 1336.732 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95 Nitrogen: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0245618 {mole fraction} * 28 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Propane: 1937 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0767746 {mole fraction} * 44.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Sulfur Dioxide: (3010.99677 {lb/event for Hydrogen Sulfide} / 34.1 {lb/lb-mole for Hydrogen Sulfide}) * 64.1 {lb/lb-mole for SO2} * 0.98 {Control Efficiency} VOC: Sum of emissions: 340.68659 {lb/event for Propane} + 169.92151 {lb/event for n-Butane} + 55.90618 {lb/event for i-Pentane} + 69.78435 {lb/event for n-Pentane} + 54.65746 {lb/event for i-Butane} + 111.11922 {lb/event for Hexane}",09/03/2017 7:01PM,09/04/2017 3:17AM,FROM THE INTERSECTION OF SR 158 GULF AVE AND FM 866 LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF GOLDSMITH 31.0 MILES W OF MIDLAND DRIVE 1.1 MILE WEST ON SR 158 TO THE GAS PLANT ON THE RIGHT,RN100222330,GOLDSMITH GAS PLANT,FINAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266801

With the second stage shut down, the pressure in the first stage increased above the setpoint that automatically shut the turbine down that led to flaring.","GOLDSMITH, ECTOR","Carbon Dioxide: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0157564 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole}Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1324.888-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 693 {mcf/event} * 1324.888 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf}Ethane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1184854 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0123881 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.018455 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0090147 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0076946 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.6811285 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0278912 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0099929 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 693 {mcf/event} * 1324.888 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 693 {mcf/event} * 1324.888 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95 Nitrogen: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0240671 {mole fraction} * 28 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Propane: 693 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0751261 {mole fraction} * 44.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Sulfur Dioxide: (1132.7679 {lb/event for Hydrogen Sulfide} / 34.1 {lb/lb-mole for Hydrogen Sulfide}) * 64.1 {lb/lb-mole for SO2} * 0.98 {Control Efficiency} VOC: Sum of emissions: 119.2702 {lb/event for Propane} + 58.35732 {lb/event for n-Butane} + 19.98595 {lb/event for i-Pentane} + 25.95556 {lb/event for n-Pentane} + 18.85515 {lb/event for i-Butane} + 38.44275 {lb/event for Hexane}",09/04/2017 8:24PM,09/04/2017 11:24PM,FROM THE INTERSECTION OF SR 158 GULF AVE AND FM 866 LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF GOLDSMITH 31.0 MILES W OF MIDLAND DRIVE 1.1 MILE WEST ON SR 158 TO THE GAS PLANT ON THE RIGHT,RN100222330,GOLDSMITH GAS PLANT,FINAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266875

The East Plant facility processes low pressure gas from natural gas producers. This low pressure gas is sent to the facility by the use of natural gas compressor stations. Enlink began lowwering the amount of natural gas entering the East Plant to minimize the flaring of natural gas. The East Plant is rated at 100 million standard cubic feet (MMSCF) per day. The actions initiated by East Plant minimized the amount of gas that was flared to approximately 10 MMSCF/day.,"Third party electrical provider was conducting maintenance on incoming electric feed line to the East Plant Facility. The third-party provider had constructed an electric by-pass (jumper) to continue uninterrupted service during the maintenance of the electric feed line. This bypass malfunctioned during the maintenance activity causing the East Plant to lose purchase power. When purchase power is lost, the facility shuts down and inlet gas normally processed by the facility is routed to the flare for safety reasons.","MIDLAND, ANDREWS","Visible observations for the opacity event (non Method 9 or 22), and company-developed emission estimation worksheets.",09/05/2017 2:15PM,09/05/2017 7:40PM,FROM THE INTX OF HWY 349 & LOOP 250 DRIVE N ON HWY 349 ABOUT 10 MI TURN L OPPOSITE A PAIR OF RADIO TOWERS AND GO W ON LEASE RD FOR 4.3 MI DRIVE AROUND BUFFALO WALLOW AND THEN DRIVE N 0.35 MI TO PLANT ACCESS RD AND ENTER PLANT,RN106570609,MIDMAR EAST GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266939

Action was taken to achieve compliance at the time of discovery. Operations increased the flow through the A turbine reducing the demand on the B turbine. The recycle valve was closed pushing gas to the second stage and allow the control system to return to normal operations. Third party contractors have been on-site with improving the control scheme that may cause the low flow and initiate the recycle.,"The emissions were caused by the sudden, unavoidable breakdown of equipment or process that was beyond the owner/operator's control, and did not stem from activity that could have been foreseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by good design, operation, and maintenance practices. The second stage on B turbine experienced low flow that forced the recycle valve to open. With the second stage shut down, the pressure in the first stage increased above the setpoint that automatically shut the turbine down that led to flaring.","GOLDSMITH, ECTOR","Carbon Dioxide: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0158652 {mole fraction} * 44 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole}Carbon Monoxide: Decode(Sign(1332.5-1000), -1, 0.5496, 0.2755) {lb/mmBtu} * 358 {mcf/event} * 1332.5 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} Ethane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.1185069 {mole fraction} * 30 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hexane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0124278 {mole fraction} * 86.2 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Hydrogen Sulfide: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0185952 {mole fraction} * 34.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Butane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0090281 {mole fraction} * 58.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) i-Pentane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.007718 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Methane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.6806887 {mole fraction} * 16 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Butane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0279197 {mole fraction} * 58.12 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) n-Pentane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0100192 {mole fraction} * 72.15 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Nitrogen Dioxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 358 {mcf/event} * 1332.5 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.05 Nitrogen Oxide: 0.2755 {lb/mmBtu} * 358 {mcf/event} * 1332.5 {Btu/scf} / 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.95 Nitrogen: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0240859 {mole fraction} * 28 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} Propane: 358 {mcf/event} * 1000 {cf/mcf} * 0.0751453 {mole fraction} * 44.1 {lb/lb-mole} / 385 {scf/lb-mole} * (1 - 0.98) Sulfur Dioxide: (589.62723 {lb/event for Hydrogen Sulfide} / 34.1 {lb/lb-mole for Hydrogen Sulfide}) * 64.1 {lb/lb-mole for SO2} * 0.98 {Control Efficiency} VOC: Sum of emissions: 61.63008 {lb/event for Propane} + 30.17787 {lb/event for n-Butane} + 10.35603 {lb/event for i-Pentane} + 13.44379 {lb/event for n-Pentane} + 9.75494 {lb/event for i-Butane} + 19.92296 {lb/event for Hexane}",09/05/2017 7:00PM,09/06/2017 3:30AM,FROM THE INTERSECTION OF SR 158 GULF AVE AND FM 866 LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF GOLDSMITH 31.0 MILES W OF MIDLAND DRIVE 1.1 MILE WEST ON SR 158 TO THE GAS PLANT ON THE RIGHT,RN100222330,GOLDSMITH GAS PLANT,FINAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,266948

Proceed to Step 3 for flaring episodes. Step 3: For flaring episodes, 98 percent destruction efficiency is used for Calculation of VOC emissions. Products of combustion are calculated in Steps 4 and 5. Example using propane: Mass of Propane Emitted = (1 - 0.98)(5,818 lb) = 116.36 lb This calculation is repeated for each gas component and the emission rate is transferred automatically to the U/M Form. Step 4: Calculate NOx and CO Emissions from Combustion. Products of combustion, namely NOx and CO are calculated using AP-42 emission factors for flares. Specifically, the factors are taken from AP-42 Table 13.5-1, 4/15. Example calculations: NOx Factor = 0.068 lb/mmbtu CO Factor = 0.31 lb/mmbtu Lower Heat Value of Gas = 1305 btu/scf (obtained from gas analysis) Mass Emission, lb = AP-42 Factor x LHV x Flared Volume NOx Emission = 0.068 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 50.76 lb CO Emission = 0.31 lb/mmbtu x 1305 mmbtu/mmscf x 0.572 mmscf= 231.41 lb Step 5: Calculate SO2 Emissions from Combustion. SO2 emissions are calculated based on the H2S concentration in the gas stream to be flared. Assumes 100 percent conversion of H2S to SO2. Western’s facilities are all in sweet gas service, therefore, H2S emissions are negligible for any assumed destruction efficiency. Example calculations: H2S Concentration = 0.5 ppm Gas Volume Flared = 572,000 scf Mass Emission =((Flared Volume)(H2S Fraction)/(H2S Ideal Gas Density))(MW SO2/MW H2S) =(572,000 scf)(.5ppm/1,000,000)/(11.14 lb/scf)((64.07lb SO2 /lb-mole)/(34.08 lb H2S /lb-mole)) = 0.05 lb SO2 = 276.19 lb",09/02/2017 10:05AM,09/07/2017 10:05AM,8900 FM 1555,RN100223890,BENEDUM GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,267098

"TMPA reviews opacity events, such as this, in an effort to improve procedures that will minimize opacity events related to start-up, shutdown,and maintenance. Flue gas is routed through a functioning scrubber tower whenever fans are running. Because the scrubber is known to be aneffective particulate removal device, TMPA believes that its use during these times will minimize if not eliminate ""actual"" opacity exceedances. TMPA will energize the ESP in accordance with TMPA's standard shutdown and start-up procedures.","The Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA) experienced an apparent exceedance of it 30-day average mercury emission limit of 1.2 lbs/TeraBtu under the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) on 09/10/17. The 30-day average value recorded by the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) for 09/10/2017 was 1.203 lbs/TeraBtu. There are several factors which may have contributed to this situation which I will discuss below. 1. TMPA is attempting to use all of its coal pile by early October in preparation for its winter shut down as it transitions to seasonal operation. In places the pile is already down to dirt. This clearing of the pile means that coal that has been in the pile for a very long time has recently been burned in the boiler. TMPA plans to take some core samples of this “bottom of the pile coal” to determine if its chemical nature, including its mercury content, is significantly different from the more recently burned coal. It is even possible that some of this “bottom of the pile coal” was left on the ground from prior to the conversion to burning Powder Ridge Basin coal (PRB). Prior to this conversion TMPA burned locally mined lignite. If analysis of these core samples shows that some of the old lignite is still present and has been burned in the boiler then the 1.2 lbs Hg/TeraBtu MATS limit would not be applicable. Locally mined lignite would meet the definition of “Low Rank Coal” in the MATS for which the emission limit is 4.0 lbs Hg/TeraBtu. EPA has communicated by letter to TMPA that the burning of any amount of low rank coal is sufficient to trigger the 4.0 lbs/TeraBtu limit. TMPA will provide a copy of the EPA communications on this topic to the TCEQ.2. TMPA’s mercury control system consists of three parts. a. The coal is sprayed with a calcium bromide solution as it enters the pulverizers ahead of the boiler. The calcium bromide promotes the conversion of the elemental mercury in the coal to its ionic form in the boiler so that it can be captured within the scrubber. b. The scrubber provides a high surface area interface between the flue gas from the boiler and an aqueous solution. Mercury in its ionic form is very soluble in water so an aqueous media provides the ideal environment for scrubbing the mercury from the flue gas. Unfortunately the solubility limit of mercury in water is relatively low. This means that the scrubber liquor quickly becomes saturated with mercury and is unable to remove more mercury. c. This scrubber liquor saturation necessitates the third step in TMPA’s mercury control process: the addition of a mercury precipitation agent to the scrubber liquor. The mercury precipitation agent promotes the removal/precipitation of mercury from the scrubber liquor, reducing its concentration in the liquor phase, thereby allowing additional mercury from the flue gas to dissolve into the scrubber liquor and subsequently precipitated out. 3. Over the last several weeks TMPA has experienced several problems with its mercury control system which have led to several periods of increased levels of mercury emissions. For worker safety reasons TMPA switched last spring from the mercury precipitation agent that it had been using, sodium hydrosulfide, to a commercial preparation called KleenScrub. The primary concern associated with using sodium hydrosulfide was that it has a high potential to lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide gas. Both of these chemicals have a tendency to plug the in j e","CARLOS, GRIMES","The Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), the Continuous Opacity Monitoring System (COMS), manual opacity readings, and theDistributed Control System (DCS) are used to determine emission quantities.

Adjust reflux cooling fans.,AGI compressor shutdown on high suction temperature.,"FORT STOCKTON, PECOS","A representative gas analysis and a calculated flared gas volume for the event was used to calculate emissions. The unauthorized emissions did not stem from any activity or event that could have been forseen and avoided, and could not have been avoided by better design operation and maintenance practices. The air pollution control equipment and processes were maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good practice for minimizing emissions and reducing the number of emission events. The amount and duration of the unauthorized emissions were minimized by placing the AGI system back in service as soon as the temperature was reduced and the use of the AGI flare. The emission monitoring system (AGI flare meter) was in service during the event. Actions in response to the unauthorized emission are documented on operating and flare logs. The shutdown of the AGI due to high suction temperature is not a frequent or recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation or maintenance. There was no offsite impact. No exceedance of the NAAQS, PSD increments or cause a condition of air pollution.",09/13/2017 3:15PM,09/13/2017 5:40PM,"FROM FM 1450, GO 0.5 MI S ON FM 1776, THEN 1 MI W.",RN100211408,WAHA GAS PLANT,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,267683

The controls will be diagnosed and repaired/replaced as necessary during the next scheduled downtime, 9/17/17, to prevent further issues.","While GM continues to investigate the incident, initial indications are that the logic controls for the Durr emission abatement system appear to have failed, potentially causing an emissions event. The logic control failure appears to have caused the abatement system to fall below compliance temperature and also disabled the alarm, interlocks, and notifications which typically would have automatically shut down production.","ARLINGTON, TARRANT",GM continues to evaluate the degree to which the malfunction impacted our ability to comply with 19156 Condition 14.,09/12/2017 9:30PM,09/13/2017 7:30AM,,RN102505963,GENERAL MOTORS,INITIAL REPORT,EMISSIONS EVENT,267687
